Machine Learning Model Training App

This project provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to train machine learning models based on a given dataset and task. Users can choose the dataset, task, and machine learning model, and then tweak the model parameters as needed.
Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/machine-learning-model-training-app.git

    Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Prepare your dataset by placing it in the data directory. The dataset should be in CSV format.

    Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

Usage

    Select the dataset from the dropdown menu.
    Choose the task: Regression or Classification.
    Select the machine learning model:
        Regression: Random Forest Regressor
        Classification: Random Forest Classifier
    Tweak the model parameters as needed.
    Click the "Train Model" button to train the model.
    The trained model will be saved as a joblib file in the models directory.

Example

Suppose you have a dataset named your_dataset.csv with features feature1, feature2, and target.

    Select your_dataset.csv from the dropdown menu.
    Choose the task "Regression".
    Select "Random Forest Regressor" as the model.
    Choose feature1 and feature2 as the features.
    Select target as the target variable.
    Tweak the model parameters if needed.
    Click the "Train Model" button.

The trained model will be saved as regression_model.joblib in the models directory.
